    Purpose / Overview:
    ------------------
    It is from this script the WSGI Production- level   deployment   module  
    imports   the `deploy.server` object - itself imported & pulled from the
    `app` object ‚Äî (i.e., the flask-derived [/`flask.Flask()`-esque]
    `dash.Dash()` main "app" [object]).For  Development-level  deployment ,
    simply run this script, like so:

        $ python deploy.py

    as applicable. (I.e., User's browser tab does not actually reload when
    changing URL - unless of course it is the first load or a reload of the
    standard base application URL; applicable programmed changes are
    returned for certain expected non-standard, specific URL href path
    extensions.)


    Callbacks
    ---------
        ## Inputs
        pathname : str
            attr from `dcc.Location` | Current URL in user's browser tab address
            bar excluding the protocol [i.e. http], domain [i.e. localhost], &
            port [i.e. 9001 or 9999] and also any hash [i.e. '#[...]'] or
            search params [i.e. '?a=this&b=that']. E.g.,:
                >>> href.pathname
                >>> '/dash-webapp-template'
        href : str
            attr from `dcc.Location` | The complete URL currently in user's
            browser tab address bar (e.g.,
            'http://localhost:9001/dash-webapp-template/#log-in')

        ## States
        current_page : list
            components list attr from `html.Div` (id='page-content')
            Components list of what is currently displayed on UI page.
            Same callback parameter object as that returned. Required for
            checking if 'page-content' is empty or not (i.e., whether the
            callback is the first load vs. a subsequent URL change).

    Returns
    -------
    html.Div:
        Dash component App UI full main page's worth of components -
        arrayed via list attr 'children'

    Raises
    ------
    PreventUpdate
        Bypass any change in page components content when reacting
        to certain [URL] situations; for example in-page section
        links (i.e., enabling user-controlled rapid page scroll
        navigation)

""" NOTE - Application Deployment:
 --------------------------------------
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   TWO PRINCIPAL MODES OF DEPLOYMENT AVAILABLE:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For best overview of details, see:
  - https://dash.plot.ly/deployment
  - http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html#nginx-configuration

  All new features are first developed in DEVELOPMENT mode!

  Successfully passed inspection following UI-based testing
  (including by non-developer end-user(s)) strictly required prior to
  any code changes (enhancements, bug fixes, package dependency version
  upgrades, etc.) being permitted to merge with master branch.

  Git link: https://github.com/jcollins-bioinfo/dash-webapp-template

  App app deployment as initiated herein is dependent on the
  following local absolute minimum .py files:
   [for: SERVER ACCESS]
   - app/wsgi.py
   - app/__init__.py
   - launch_gunicorn.sh
   [for: CONTENT DELIVERY] (reactively)
   - app/layout.py
   - app/callbacks.py
