# Overview of /dash-webapp-template/seqapp/ file structure

./assets/
---------
Contains custom CSS, JS, and media files. The name "assets" is explicitly
searched for by the Dash modules.

./config/
---------
Application configuration - largely contained within the local __init__.py file.

./dependencies/
---------------
This is purely for developer reference and is not functionally used/required.

./prod/
-------
This gitignore'd directory contains the subfolder
/dash-webapp-template/seqapp/prod/sessions, where all user session analysis
files are written to and historically accumulating.

./tabs/
-------
Contains the Dash-HTML-Python style code precisely laying out every detail
of the front-end (i.e., all the react.js components, overall organization,
and CSS styling).

./callbacks.py
--------------
Source code for all of the "react"-ive (i.e., dynamic / interactive) components
on the web app UI, thus bridging frontend <-> backend (all in Python).

./layout.py
-----------
A basic small wrapper module which feeds the Dash-HTML-Python style code from
the './tabs/' directory - thus any app made from this template can have multiple
different tabs filled with their own distinct react.js (but Dash/python written)
components, all loaded in one page load and updated independently, dynamically,
as the user navigates through any possible labryinthine series of UI decisions
(actions; e.g., mouse clicks, etc.) during their UX of the app. 

./utils.py
----------
Some generic utility functions.
